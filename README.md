# Credit Card Approval Prediction

## Project overview
In this project, we aim to identify the factors that influence whether a credit card applicant is classified as a “good” or “bad” client. Using historical data, we analyze various applicant attributes, including years employed, total income, age, education level, family or marital status, and “properties owned”. By leveraging machine learning techniques, we built a predictive model to assess creditworthiness, providing valuable insights into the characteristics associated with timely or overdue payments. 

## Key findings
**Analysis**
- higher education = higher on-time payback rate
- more children = lower on-time payback rate
- home ownership = higher on-time payback rate

**Models**
- Decision Tree: can identify specific patterns for true positives (paying on time)
- Random Forests: more robust, better handling true negatives (not paying on time) due to their ensemble nature & ability to generalize
  
## Data sources
- Credit card application and transaction records
- Institutional Classifications: Employment & income details, personal demographics, financial assets
- Demographic Breakdown: Applicant’s age, education level, marital status, and property ownership
